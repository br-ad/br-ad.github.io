        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>I’m a big fan of reading. When I thought about a product to reimagine and redesign, I immediately thought of Goodreads. Goodreads is a social network for people who like to read. Goodreads catalogs 1.5 billion books and has an impressive 55 million
            members who have left over 50 million reviews. It’s one of my favorite social networks because of it’s content, but it leaves a lot to be desired in form and function.</p>
        <p>Goodreads has some great goals:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>See what your freinds are reading</li>
            <li>Track the books you’ve read, want to read, and are reading now</li>
            <li>Review, discuss, and share books</li>
            <li>Get book recommendations</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I’ve been a member since 2013—While they’ve improved a lot there are a handful problems that I run into regularly.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Finding new books is harder than it needs to be. There is little to none editorial/recommending/curating happening.</li>
            <li>There are so many features that have been tacked on over the years that the entire product feels overwhelming and busy. From my own use I was able to identify features could be downplayed: Trivia, Quizzes, Creative Writing, Giveaways, News
                and Blog</li>
            <li>It’s hard to view books by author or genre. Everything should be linkable! Authors, Genres, Publishers, Awards!</li>
            <li>Shelves and Lists are too similar. Could they be the same if there was an option to have public bookshelves that anyone could contribute to?</li>
            <li>The friend system is confusing</li>
            <li>Buying books through the site is overly confusing, there are 14 vendors!</li>
            <li>There is no way to identify topics within a book. A new topic tagging system would work really well to help you know if there are any triggers in a book you are reading.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I started out by dumping all of my preconceived thoughts onto paper. This included a lot of lists, documenting attributes, identifying the main sections of the product (how can I simplify and improve the experience?), a little brainstorming to
            search for any delight that could be added (Sort your bookshelves based on the color of the cover!) and writing down any open questions I had. </p>

        <h3>My goals in this redesign were:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Reduce the clutter and focus on the books</li>
            <li>Improve the overall usability and readability</li>
            <li>Offer a simple collection view that can be filtered and sorted</li>
            <li>Make the bookshelf concept more visual</li>
            <li>Show a lot of new and interesting books in the explore section</li>
            <li>Keep the simple ratings and reviews system.</li>
            <li>Allow for navigation through to authors and publishers to find even more books!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tools</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Pencil & Paper</li>
            <li>Sketch</li>
            <li>HTML & CSS</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Sketches</h2>

        <p>I started sketching out some simple mobile layouts that could be used for a native app or a responsive site. I knew I wanted the main way you interact with your bookshelves to be swiping on mobile.</p>

    <section class="writing">
        <p>From there I was able to sketch some rough desktop sizes. This included a good amount of the screens I would mockup for the final design.</p>

    <img src="assets/sketches/desktopsketches.jpg">
    <section class="writing">
        <p>After that I spent a little time focusing on some of the micro interactions across the site. How should filtering and sorting work? How can you add something to your collection? Is it different than adding it to a shelf?</p>

        <h2>Wireframes</h2>

        <p>A lot of descisions were made in this phase of the project:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Overall app structure, page layout and responsive design system</li>
            <li>What should go on each page (elements and patterns)</li>
            <li>I also decided that I would be focusing on the desktop sizes to get the most out of my time.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I wanted to work from real data so I took this time to gather enough book titles, authors, and covers to use throuhgout the design. I set up my styles and symbols in sketch so I could quickly apply changes across all of the pages.</p>

        <h3>Collection</h3>
        <p>Here you can see all of your books (paginated) as well as filter them by name, genre, topic, if you’ve reviewed it or not, and if you’ve read it. You can also sort by date added, alphabetical, highest rated, most popular, date published, and sorted
            by color! When you hover over the book you see the cover lift up and show depth and you can see how many of your friends also have the book in their collection.</p>

        <h3>Shelves</h3>
        <p>The top of your shelves view is your “Currently Reading” shelf. Any book that you have set to currently reading will be added here. You can update the progress for each book and the graph will animate to the new position. You’ll also get a “Favorites”
            default shelf. This will help your friends and followers get a good picture of what you like. You can continue to create as many shelves as you’d like.</p>
